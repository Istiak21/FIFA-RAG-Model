# ‚öΩ Euro 2020 and FIFA 2002-2022 Question-Answering RAG System

## üìå Overview

This repository contains two custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) question-answering systems built for major international football tournaments:

1. **FIFA World Cup (2002‚Äì2022) RAG Model**
2. **UEFA Euro 2020 RAG Model**

Both systems scrape tournament data from Wikipedia, process and chunk the text, embed it into a vector database using `FAISS` and `Hugging Face` sentence embeddings, and then answer natural language questions using the `Together.ai` API and the `meta-llama/Llama-3-8b-chat-hf` model ‚Äî all powered by LangChain and BeautifulSoup.

## üèÜ Projects

### üìñ 1Ô∏è‚É£ FIFA World Cup (2002‚Äì2022) RAG Model

- Scrapes detailed match reports, tables, squads, and summaries from Wikipedia pages of the FIFA World Cups from 2002 to 2022.
- Splits text into overlapping chunks for context preservation.
- Converts text into vector embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- Stores embeddings in a `FAISS` vector database.
- Uses a retriever with **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** for better context diversity.
- Accepts user questions with optional year-specific filtering (e.g., _"Who won in 2010?"_).
- Generates accurate answers grounded in retrieved context via the `Together.ai` chat API.
- Displays sources alongside answers.

### üìñ 2Ô∏è‚É£ UEFA Euro 2020 RAG Model

- Scrapes the Wikipedia page for UEFA Euro 2020.
- Splits article text into overlapping chunks.
- Converts text into vector embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
- Stores embeddings in a `FAISS` vector database.
- Uses a similarity-based retriever.
- Accepts user questions and provides context-aware answers.
- Uses `Together.ai` and the `meta-llama/Llama-3-8b-chat-hf` model for natural language generation.
